xpl-plugwise-perl
---------------

This package automatically sets up the xPL Perl hub service.  By
default the xPL Perl hub listens on IP address 127.0.0.1 and
broadcasts on the same address.  These defaults can be modified
for all xPL Perl clients by editing the /etc/xpl-perl/env/IP
and /etc/xpl-perl/env/IPSEND files respectively.
