Revision history for Perl extension xPL.

{{$NEXT}}

        - Major API changes.  Warns if deprecated functionality is
          use.  Setting XPL_MESSAGE_VALIDATE environment variable
          gets back validation behaviour and implicit message type
          guessing but this behaviour should not normally be relied 
          upon.
        - Replace xPL::Message class/class_type fields with single
          schema field.
        - Make xPL::Message body parameter take an array to reliably
          preserve order without requiring external schema data.
        - Remove strictness/validation from xPL::Message (to get old
          behaviour set XPL_MESSAGE_VALIDATE environment variable to
          1).
        - Remove xPL::RF source field and make xPL::RF parsing return
          xPL::Message arguments rather than actual xPL::Messages to
          make parsers less coupled to xPL.
        - Make xPL::Message immutable - move the only mutation logic
          to xPL::Bridge.
        - Test improvements: more coverage, fewer test dependencies.
        - Add AnyEvent support to xPL::Listener.
        - SMS::Send::CSoft and SMS::Send::SMSDiscount moved to CPAN
          and debian packages placed in the xpl-perl repository.
        - xPL::Dock::XOSD now has --xosd-offset and --xosd-indent
          options for vertical and horizontal offsets.
        - Debian package improvements.
        - xPL::RF::RFXMeter report count rather than kwh since we can't
          tell if the device is an RFXMeter or RFXPower.  Thanks to
          Thomas Chiroux and others for pointing this out.
        - New xpl-smart client: Like xpl-hddtemp but works for more
          drives and reports them by serial number rather than device
          name which might change over time.

        - xpl-bluetooth use service discovery to poll devices.  Thanks
          to Nicolas Goubaux.
        - xpl-owfs improve humidity DAC support.  Thanks to Marc
          Merlin.
        - xpl-rfxcom-rx support for the occasional long messages from
          THGR328N.  Thanks to Thomas Chiroux.
        - xpl-rfxcom-rx support for WGR800.  Thanks to Jason Heiss and
          Eric Riemers.
        - xpl-rfxcom-rx support for UVN800.  Thanks to Thomas Chiroux.
        - xpl-rfxcom-rx support for PCR800.  Thanks to Willi Herzig.
        - xpl-rfxcom-rx improved support for WGTR800.  Thanks to Willi
          Herzig.
        - xpl-mpd support playing specific track using custom 'track'
          field.
        - Add sensor.basic type=pressure support.  Thanks to Thomas
          Chiroux.
        - Add event callbacks so clients can get callbacks for events
          like 'hub_found', etc.
        - xpl-sender support for multivalued fields.
        - xpl-mythtv support for MythTV version 0.22 or later
        - Some config.{basic,app} support.
        - xPL::Dock improvements so less boilerplate code is required
          in clients.
        - Renamed xpl-osd to xpl-xosd
        - New client: xpl-wol to send wake-on-lan packets (uses
          non-standard schema).
        - New client: xpl-fdnotify display osd.basic messages using
          standard (Linux) desktop notifications.
        - New client: xpl-config to query/set client configuration.
        - New client: xpl-datetime to replace non-standard xpl-clock
        - Experimental: xpl-jabber client (for google talk, etc)
        - Experimental: xpl-gpower client for Google powermeter API.
        - Experimental: Debian xpl-*-perl packages that actually set up some
          clients.
        - Experimental: xPL::Client stealth mode; so you can run
          (for example) xpl-fdnotify on a laptop and not worry
          about it transmitting lots of hbeat messags (requires
          all clients to be using hubless mode).

0.10 Tue,  9 Jun 2009 22:42:11 +0100

        - Lots of refactoring:
          * Removed approximately 1/5th of the code.
          * Moved code from scripts (w/ 0% test coverage) to modules
            (99.6% test coverage) which should make things easier to
            maintain.  Script directory now has 28% of the total
            codebase rather than 67% as in previous release.
        - New helper modules:
          * xPL::IOHandler - generic handler writing common record
            types to serial or socket-based devices.  Handles queuing
            writes and encoding/decoding of outgoing/incoming
            messages.
          * xPL::Dock - support clients as "plugins".  Most existing
            clients have been converted to this form and one client
            xpl-rfxcom has been created as an example of how to use
            two plugins (RFXComRX and RFXComTX) in one client.  This
            is intended to help developers wanting to write a single
            "embedded-style" client with support for multiple devices.
            A side-effect of this is that much more code is now in
            modules and not scripts so much more code can be tested
            effectively.
        - New client: xpl-mythtv - monitor utilisation of tuners on a
          mythtv backend
        - New client: xpl-easydaq - for EasyDAQ usb relay modules from
          http://www.easydaq.biz
        - New client: xpl-bluetooth - for simple bluetooth proximity
        - New client: xpl-linux - for monitoring linux health (mostly
          laptops since my house now runs on a Samsung NC10).
        - New client: xpl-apcupsd - for monitor a UPS using the apcups
          daemon, http://www.apcupsd.com/
        - Renamed client: xpl-rfxcom w/device id rfxcom to
          xpl-rfxcom-rx/rfxcomrx.
        - Renamed client: xpl-rfxcom-trans w/id rfxcomt to
          xpl-rfxcom-tx/rfxcomtx.
        - Renamed client: xpl-x10 to xpl-heyu with corresponding
          device id change.
        - xpl-heyu: support for new "heyu monitor" output format.
        - xpl-currentcost: support new CC128/Envi energy monitors.
        - xpl-rfxcom-tx: increased ack timeout as suggested by Bert.
        - xpl-rfxcom-rx: support for THN132N - thanks to roger78.
        - Lots of documentation updates.
        - Support of using YAML::Syck instead of YAML for schema
          parsing for faster startup of clients.
        - xPL::Message 20% speedup on 10k message benchmark
        - xPL::Message lazy instantiation of schema classes - speedup
          of 10% for xpl-sender using only 1 schema class.
        - xpl-perl-setup several fixes suggested by Clarke Brunt.
        - All clients: Support hubless mode (using SO_REUSEADDR) for
          use on devices like the NSLU2 when only xPL-Perl is being
          used.

0.09 Sun,  4 Jan 2009 17:00:00 +0000

        - New client: xpl-udin for a Audon UDIN usb relay device.
        - New client: xpl-currentcost for a Current Cost energy meter.
        - All clients: "kill -USR1 <pid>" dumps some statistics about
          time spent in callbacks.
        - xpl-viom: Add initialisation to script.  Thanks to Boyd Hitchcock
          for reminding me.
        - xPL::Timer::{sunrise,sunset} support time zone correctly.
        - xPL::Message: minor speed up to message_type validation.
        - Fixed instance_id length in xPL::Client.  No idea why this
          was wrong here but not in xPL::Message.  Thanks to Francois
          Corthay for spotting this.
        - xpl-dmx: Added support for vendor specific 'fade=[seconds]'
          field.
        - xpl-lcdproc: Missing in manifest.  Oops.
        - xpl-clock: Minor command line option fixes.  Thanks to Francois
          Corthay.
	- DEPRECATED: xpl-csoft-sms, xpl-digitemp, xpl-mplayer,
	  xpl-sql-logger and xPL::SQL have been removed.

0.08 Sun, 16 Nov 2008 22:04:39 +0000

        - xpl-lcdproc: New client to display osd.basic messages on an
          LCD that is supported by LCDProc. See
          http://lcdproc.sf.net/.
        - xpl-ctx35: Fix bug in extended function handling.  Thanks to
          Jeroen Hendriks for the patch.
        - xpl-mpd: Simple media.basic client for the music player
          daemon from http://www.musicpd.org/
	- xpl-rfxcom, xpl-rfxcom-trans: Support for homeeasy.basic.
        - xpl-rfxcom: Support for RFXSensor informational/diagnostic
          messages.
	- xpl-rfxcom: Support for X10 KR21 security keyfobs.
	- xpl-rfxcom: Support all three sensors of electrisave/owl devices.
          Thanks to DavidMbrookE for doing the hard part.
	- xpl-rfxcom: Improved RTGR328N date/time support.
	- xpl-rfxcom: THGR328N support.
	- xpl-rfxcom: Attempt at Oregon Scientific GR101 scales support.
	- Lots of improvements to developer documentation.
	- DEPRECATED: xpl-csoft-sms, xpl-digitemp, xpl-mplayer,
	  xpl-sql-logger and xPL::SQL.  They'll be dropped in the next
	  release unless someone shouts.

0.07  Sun,  6 Apr 2008 20:40:29 +0100

        - All clients are converted to use Getopt::Long and now support
          passing arbitrary parameters to the xPL::Client constructor
          using '--define key=value' options on the command line.
        - xpl-perl-setup script should now do something reasonable
          on Fedora/RedHat.
        - xpl-dmx - added support for dmx.confirm messages and provide
          a default colour set in case /etc/X11/rgb.txt does not exist.
          Thanks to DesG.
        - xpl-rfxcom: Added support for BTHR918, BWR102 and THGR810.
        - xpl-rfxcom: Generate sensor.basic type=battery messages.  Devices
          supporting only a low battery flag just send a value of 90%
          normally and 10% if the low flag is set.  (osd.basic messages
          are no longer generated.)
        - xpl-rfxcom: Improve parsing of received messages (10 times faster).
        - xpl-rfxcom: Improved test coverage for Oregon devices.
        - xpl-x10 - send confirms for all heyu initiated messages not
          just those generated by xpl-x10 itself.
        - xpl-x10 - fix unit addressing to recognise when multiple units
          have been addressed at once.
        - xpl-x10 client now forks a helper program so that calls to
          'heyu' are made asynchronously.
        - xpl-x10 more efficient addressing.  An x10.basic message
          with device=i4,i6,i8,i10 is passed to heyu as 'i4,6,8,10'
          rather than four separate calls.  This makes this client
          much more efficient/responsive.
        - xPL::Message doesn't corrupt arguments passed to the constructor.
        - All clients now use POD::Usage so usage text and manual pages
          share the same text rather than having (inaccurate) duplication.
        - Simple queue abstraction added, xPL::Queue.  Used by xpl-x10,
          xpl-rfxcom-trans, xpl-dmx, xpl-viom, etc.

0.06 Sat, 6 Oct 2007 21:53:37 +0100

	- New mailing lists: announce@xpl-perl.org.uk, dev@xpl-perl.org.uk
	- New client: xpl-ctx35 experimental (transmit only) support for
	  CTX35/TI103/TI203/TI213 X10 Transceiver.  Thanks to Eric-jan
	  Riemers for testing.
	- New client: xpl-sms-send.  More generic SMS sending using
	  SMS::Send drivers from CPAN.
	- Added to SMS::Send drivers one for CSoft (tested) and one for
	  SMSDiscount (untested since I don't have an account) both of
	  these will probably move to CPAN.
	- New script: xpl-tty-tcp make a serial/USB device available on
	  a TCP port.  Allows multiple clients to connect at once though
	  I don't recemmend it.  It is primarily intended to allow me
	  to emulate a networked RFXCom transmitter/receiver for testing
	  purposes.
	- RFXCom: Experimental transmitter support.
	- RFXCom: Several improvements to the receiver client.  Thanks
	  to Bert for his comments on the xpl-dev@xpl-home.org list on
	  Wed, 04 Jul 2007 12:30:53 -0400.
	- RFXCom: RFXSensor negative temperature support (untested).
	- RFXCom: Oregon THWR288A support.  Thanks to Eric-jan Riemers for
	  test data and testing.
	- RFXMeter/RFXPower: Bug fixing.  Thanks to Rick Klaassen.
	- RFXCom: Support for WGR918.  Thanks to Rick Klaassen for test
	  data, testing and bug fixing.
	- RFXCom: Visonic PowerCode and CodeSecure devices.  I'd still
	  like to implemente parity (or similar) checking for CodeSecure
	  device if such a thing is possible.
	- RFXCom: Support for networked (as well as USB) receivers and
	  transmitters.  Thanks to Bert for allowing me access to a device
	  for testing.
	- RFXCom: Improved handling of duplicate messages in RFXCom receiver
	  code.
	- Support for MacOS/X and FreeBSD
	- Rewrite of X10 encoding/decoding and added tests to cover this
	  code.
	- Allow overriding of the default time zone using the TZ
	  environment variable.  Thanks to Eric-jan Riemers for bug
	  reporting and testing.
	- Allow clients to register callbacks for xPL messages using filters
	  defined using code references rather than simply regular expressions.
	- Improved test coverage.
	- Improved support for security.zone messages.
	- Improved behaviour when using a loopback interface.
	- Minor fix to hddtemp output parsing/reporting.
	- Minor bug fixes to xPL::SQL - thanks to Eric for the bug
	  reports.  It might be worth noting that I don't actually
	  use this code.
	
0.05  Sun, 17 Jun 2007 21:33:22 +0100

	- BIG CHANGE: Message schema are now encoded as YAML datafiles and
	  not as Perl modules.  The YAML module is now required.  It is
	  avaliable as a Debian package called libyaml-perl and (probably)
	  an RPM package called perl-YAML.
	- New tool: xpl-rrd-graphs to convert rrd files as produced by
	  xpl-rrd into graphs under /var/www/rrd.
	- New *experimental* tool: xpl-perl-setup to setup the xPL-Perl
	  clients Feedback on this would be *very* useful.
	- New client: xpl-rfxcom to decode messages from RFXCOM receivers.
	- New client: xpl-csoft-sms: SMS sending client using the service
	  at: http://www.csoft.co.uk/
	- New client: xpl-monitor - a graphical debug tool - not complete
	- Mew tool: xpl-packet-trace - a TCP packet decoding tool for xPL
	  messages
	- xPL::Client: Support for hbeat.request messages.
	- xpl-sender: Support for waiting for responses.  Useful for
	  things like "xpl-sender -w 10 -c hbeat.request".
	- xpl-w800: added support for some X10 security sensors.
	- xPL::Message: improved support for duplicate fields in body of
	  messages
	- xPL::Message: allow empty message body
	- xpl-mplayer: Multiple playlist support - send two play command
	  messages quickly to rotate to next playlist.
	- xpl-x10: added extended function support.
	- xpl-x10: support for recent heyu-2.0beta releases
	- xpl-sql: fixes to the documentation - Thanks to Erik for the bug
	  report.
	- New schema: datetime.basic, dawndusk.request, hbeat.request,
	  sendmsg.basic, x10.security
	- Lots of performance improvements to the code used for xPL
	  messages.


0.04  Sat Mar  3 19:00:00 GMT 2007
        - Implemented lazy parsing of xPL message header and body to
            give 400% speedup for hubs (which ignore everything but
            the hop count) and significant improvement to typical clients.
        - New client: xpl-dmx
            Interface to the 512 Channel Serial to DMX transmitter

        - Added support for xPL::Timer::Recurrence wrapper around
            DateTime::Event::Recurrence as an alternative to the Cron-style
            which seems to have an infinite loop bug inheritted from
            DateTime::Event::Cron.
	- Updated xpl-owfs for 1-wire interface to support humidity
            sensors and relay outputs.

        - New client: xpl-rrd
        - New client: xpl-sql-logger (in progress - api/table changes likely)
        - New client: xpl-viom
        - New client: xpl-w800
        - New message types: cid.basic, tts.basic, dawndusk.basic,
                             sensor.basic, control.basic
        - Bug: closed filehandles were not removed properly

0.02  Tue Dec 13 19:39:48 GMT 2005
        - Some API changes:
          * 'xpl-*' - '-i' now specifies and interface.
